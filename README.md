# Integration Test Example in Dart for Flutter
This is an example of how to write integration tests in Dart for Flutter applications. Integration tests are used to test the interactions between different components of an application, such as testing the integration between UI widgets, state management, and backend APIs.

## Getting Started
To get started with integration tests in Dart for Flutter, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

2. Create a Flutter project using the flutter create command or open an existing Flutter project.

3. In your Flutter project, create a new directory called `integration_test` at the root level. This is where you will write your integration tests.

4. Inside the `integration_test` directory, create a new Dart file for your integration test. You can name it based on the component or functionality you want to test.

5. Open the Dart file for your integration test and import the necessary packages, such as `flutter_test` for writing Flutter tests and `integration_test` for running integration tests.

6. Define a test function using the testWidgets function provided by the flutter_test package. This function will contain the actual integration test logic.

7. Inside the test function, use the await keyword to perform asynchronous tasks, such as launching the app, interacting with UI widgets, and making API requests.

8. Use the expect function provided by the flutter_test package to assert the expected results of your integration test. You can use various matcher functions, such as expect, equals, contains, matches, etc., to perform assertions.

9. Run your integration test using the flutter test command in the terminal or by running the test directly from your IDE.

10. Analyze the test results to verify if your integration test has passed or failed. If it failed, debug the issue and fix it before running the test again.

## Example Integration Test
#### In this repository, in the ``integration_test`` directory, you can find some best examples of integration tests in Dart for Flutter.


### Result of this tests from console:
`11:02 7/7: All tests passed!`
